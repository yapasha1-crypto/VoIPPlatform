You must update ..\PROJECT_STATUS.md.

- Keep it concise and technical (bullet points).
- Include:
  - Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - What changed (files / endpoints / UI routes if relevant)
  - Verification steps executed (commands, curl, tests)
  - Known issues / next step
- Do NOT rewrite the whole document. Minimal edit/append only.
